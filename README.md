This project is written in Java and is used to calculate the maturity amount of a Recurring Deposit (RD).
The program asks the user to enter the number of test cases, and then for each test case it takes the values of tenure, principal, age, and gender. 
It first validates the inputs and only if they are correct, it calculates the total deposited money, the interest earned, and the maturity amount. 
If the inputs are wrong, it displays an error message instead of doing the calculation. 
The main purpose of this project is to practice Java concepts like object-oriented programming, exception handling, and taking user input through Scanner.
